# SapLinQ

This repository is created in order to upload the files for our SapLinQ project. SapLinQ uses the mit app inventor as well as arduino code to work.

MIT App Inventor:
The file that we created using the MIT App Inventor is the SapLinQ-MIT_App_Inventor.aia. This file can be viewed through the MIT App Inventor Website. This is what we used to create our app. It uses openweathermap api, and it is called many times throughout the program. 
The SapLinQ App also incorporates many features such as weatehr monitoring, induvidual crop changes, as well as overall water level changes for soil type.

Arduino C++ Code:
The backend code we used is the SapLinQ_Project.ino file. This is written in the arduino C++ coding language. Out app also uses a database that connects with this code in order to make the whole thing more efficient.

This is our SapLinQ project, along with all its source code. Please find it all here.
